# BRIEF.md — Tally: a Gated-Development Demo (Go + HTMX + SQLite + SonarQube)

**For:** Claude Code, running locally on the reader's machine.
**You are on the `start` branch.** It contains this brief, the gate harness (Makefile, docker-compose, SonarQube bootstrap), and empty application directories. Your job: **discover, build, and iterate the application until every gate below is green.** The `master` branch holds one finished result — do not peek; the point of this repo is that the loop, not the destination, produces the quality.

**The application — deliberately crude:** *Tally*, a tiny group-contribution tracker: members can be created, contributions recorded against members, and a dashboard shows each member's total plus the group total.
- **Backend:** Go (stdlib `net/http` or chi), JSON API: `POST /members`, `GET /members`, `POST /contributions`, `GET /summary`.
- **Frontend:** server-rendered HTML + HTMX served by the same Go binary (one language, one container — crude is the aesthetic).
- **Database:** SQLite via a CGO-free driver (`modernc.org/sqlite`), file on a compose volume.
- **Everything runs with `docker compose up`:** the app and SonarQube. Nothing deploys anywhere; localhost is the production environment.

## Rules of engagement

- **R1 — Discovery before code.** Produce `DISCOVERY.md` first (Gate 0). No application code before it is committed.
- **R2 — The gates are the definition of done.** Not "it works," not "tests mostly pass" — all gates green in a single run of `make gates`.
- **R3 — Never weaken a gate to pass it.** Do not lower the coverage threshold, exclude files to dodge smells, disable lint rules, or mark code `//nolint` without a stated justification in the commit message. Fix the code, not the referee. (One sanctioned exclusion exists: see G5 note on `main.go`.)
- **R4 — Small commits, one gate-relevant change each,** with messages that say which gate the change serves.
- **R5 — When a gate fails, read the actual failure** (test output, Sonar issue list via its API) and fix the specific finding — no shotgun rewrites.
- **R6 — Keep `main()` thin.** All logic lives in testable packages; `main` only wires and starts. This is what makes G5's 100% coverage honest rather than heroic.

## Gate 0 — Discovery → `DISCOVERY.md`

Answer with evidence, not assumption:
1. Toolchain present: Go version, Docker + compose version, `golangci-lint` availability (install locally if absent), SonarQube scanner approach (the compose file runs `sonar-scanner-cli` as a one-shot service — confirm).
2. The gate harness: read the `Makefile` targets (`build`, `unit`, `functional`, `lint`, `sonar`, `gates`) and `sonar/bootstrap.sh` (creates the **Standard Gate** in SonarQube via its API: coverage = 100%, code smells = 0, duplicated lines = 0, bugs = 0, vulnerabilities = 0, security hotspots reviewed = 100%). Confirm SonarQube boots at `localhost:9000` and the bootstrap ran.
3. Data model sketch (members, contributions), API contract, and the frontend's three screens (members, add contribution, summary).
4. Test strategy: what will be unit-tested (handlers via `httptest`, store logic) vs functionally tested (real HTTP against the composed stack, real SQLite file).
**Gate 0 passes when `DISCOVERY.md` is committed and the SonarQube Standard Gate exists.**

## Functional gates

**G1 — Build:** `make build` — `go vet ./...` clean, binary builds, `docker compose build` succeeds.
**G2 — Unit tests:** `make unit` — `go test ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out` all green. Table-driven tests expected; the coverage profile feeds G5.
**G3 — Functional tests:** `make functional` — compose stack up, then black-box HTTP tests against the running app (Go tests tagged `functional`): JSON API (create member → contribute → summary math correct to the cent; bad input rejected with proper status codes), HTML rendering (members page shows created members, contributions page has the member dropdown, summary page shows totals, statement page shows contributions with running balance), and persistence (data survives a container restart via the SQLite volume).

## Quality gates

**G4 — Lint:** `make lint` — `golangci-lint run` zero findings with the committed config (errcheck, staticcheck, gocyclo, dupl, gosec enabled).
**G5 — SonarQube Standard Gate:** `make sonar` — scanner pushes analysis + `coverage.out`; poll the quality-gate API until it reports **PASSED** against: 100% coverage, 0 smells, 0 duplication, 0 bugs, 0 vulnerabilities, 100% hotspots reviewed.
*Sanctioned exclusion:* `main.go` (wiring only, per R6) via `sonar.coverage.exclusions` — declared in `sonar-project.properties` on the `start` branch already; do not extend it.

## The loop

```
make gates   # runs G1→G5 in order, stops at first failure
```
Iterate: fix → commit → `make gates` → repeat until one clean end-to-end green run. Then run it **twice more** — flaky green is red.

---

## Improvement round (the "continuously improve" part)

After the first all-green run, execute one mini-brief *through the same loop*: **add a member statement endpoint + page** (`GET /members/{id}/statement` — chronological contributions with running balance). Discovery addendum → code → all gates green again, including back to 100% coverage. This demonstrates that the gates make change cheap, not expensive.

## Exit checklist
- [ ] `DISCOVERY.md` committed before any code
- [ ] `make gates` green three consecutive runs
- [ ] SonarQube dashboard: Standard Gate PASSED (screenshot saved to `docs/`)
- [ ] Functional persistence test proves SQLite survives restart
- [ ] Improvement round shipped through the full loop
- [ ] No gate was weakened (R3) — `git log` tells the story honestly
